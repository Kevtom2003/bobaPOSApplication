## Scrum Meeting 2
Each team member provided status updates on their progress for the tickets they are working on this sprint. Jack discussed his progress on researching the technology he would be using to connect the front end to the backend. Since we decided to use Express in the backend and Blake had experience with this technology, Blake used Express to connect the database to the backend. This will allow for Jack and Sathvik to start pulling data to display. Shu worked on the manager dashboard page and has the routes set up. Kevin created the Team meeting presentation and worked on the menu board page.
