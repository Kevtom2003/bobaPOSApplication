## Scrum Meeting 2 11/6
Each team member provided status updates on their progress for the tickets they are working on this sprint. Jack discussed his progress in researching the technology he would be using to connect the front end to the backend. Since we decided to use Express in the backend and Blake has experience with this technology, Blake used Express to connect the database to the backend. This will allow Jack and Sathvik to start pulling data to display. Shu worked on the manager dashboard page and has the routes set up. Kevin created the Team meeting presentation and worked on the menu board page.

## Scrum Meeting 3 11/7
During this scrum meeting, each team member provided their status updates and discussed current or potential blockers. Blake started by providing updates on the Jira board, noting a modification we made to the scope of this sprint since this sprint was only one week. He also completed the connection between the server and the database. Sathvik worked on the menu board so that the menu board now displays the menu items by category clearly with descriptions. Shubham updated the manager dashboard and login page to look aesthetic with the new Chakra UI. He also added descriptions to the menu items. Jack worked on the database and added ingredients and names to the menu items. Kevin has the website publicly hosted using an EC2 instance and utilized PM2 as a deployment tool so that the application will always be live.
